# Some Guidelines for Students

This provides some guidelines for people who are seeking internships, PhD and Postdoc positions.

## Current open positions

* Open PhD/Postdoc position: [Software Systems in IoT, Edge and Cloud Computing](https://rdsea.github.io/openpositions-asre.txt)
* Open PhD/Postdoc position: 	[Engineering Analytics for Big Data in  IoT, Edge and Cloud Systems](https://rdsea.github.io/openpositionsbigdataase.txt)
* Open [teaching assistant positions for Big Data Platforms 2019](https://github.com/linhsolar/bdp/blob/master/jobs/bdp-2019.md)

If you dont see an open position but still want to find out if any position is available, pls. send email to me.

## Aalto Master Thesis

* If you have a topic from industries, pls. just contact me about your topic.
* If you want to select a topic specified by me, pls. come to talk first about your interest.

For all master theses, regardless of whether the topic is from industries or from me, you will have to work on a master thesis proposal to make sure that we (you and me) come to an agreement on the research and engineering questions and plans for your thesis, **BEFORE** we can officially register the thesis. Usually the thesis proposal will be short but includes:

* The overal context of the thesis: explain the introduction of the thesis, where is the position of the thesis in a larger context of the research and education.
* Research and engineering questions: what  are engineering and/or scientific challenges that the thesis is going to solve, and why? Does anybody do it before in your context, etc.
* Expected outcomes: e.g., which knowledge, solutions or software artefacts will be delivered, and how they are mapped to the research questions. Who would benefit from the outcomes

 * Approach: more concrete on possible inputs for the thesis, e.g., dataset, tools, etc. Highlights of the work approach, e.g., steps about literature studies, implementation, validation, etc.

 Usually it would take around a month or even more with a lot of discussions to come up with a reasonable proposal, even for industrial topics. Therefore, if you want to do the thesis, you should contact me as early as possible.

A special note for students doing master thesis in industries (with advisors from industries as well):

* The student must be able to translate/map interests between an academic viewpoint (the supervising professor/me) and an industry viewpoint (the industrial advisor); these viewpoints are not necessarily the same.
    * Academic viewpoint: we want to see scientific and/or engineering questions/challenges, possible solutions w.r.t. prototypes of the ideas, lesson learned, new ideas, etc.
    * Industrial viewpoint: some industrial thesis projects just focus on implementation/engineering in the interest of the company
* After having a good draft of the proposal, we (the student, the industry advisors and the supervisor) should meet and agree. Dont expect that I will sign the thesis registration without seeing the industry advisors.
* We should meet with the industry advisors regularly about the progress of the thesis.
* I will need the industry advisors to evalute the student thesis from three aspects:
    1. **Relevancy**: is the topic relevant and timely for the company? is it challenging?
    2. **Engineering and scientific viewpoint**: the thesis result is useful for the company? Is the company able to apply/use the result? how would the company evaluate the result (average, good, very good, excellent)?
    3. **Time and teamwork**: considering the time spent for  the thesis, does the company think that the time is too short, too long or appropriate with the result? Did the student follow the teamwork and requirements of the company well?



## PhD internships

Often I do host PhD internships from other universities and research centers. In general, we should have a clear plan of what we could achieve during the internships. Therefore, before asking for the internship, pls. work on a plan and we can discuss.

## TU Wien courses

I maintain my teaching right at [TU Wien](http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/) but I dont have regular courses. If you want to do master theses, seminars or other courses, contact me directly.
