# Some Guidelines for Students

This provides some guide lines for people who seeking internships, PhD and Postdoc positions.

## Current open positions

* Open PhD/Postdoc position: [Software Systems in IoT, Edge and Cloud Computing](https://rdsea.github.io/openpositions-asre.txt)
* Open PhD/Postdoc position: 	[Engineering Analytics for Big Data in  IoT, Edge and Cloud Systems] (https://rdsea.github.io/openpositionsbigdataase.txt)
* >Open [teaching assistant positions for Big Data Platforms 2019](https://github.com/linhsolar/bdp/blob/master/jobs/bdp-2019.md)

If you dont see an open position but still want to find out if any position is available, pls. send email to me.

## Aalto Master Thesis

* If you have a topic from industries, pls. just contact me about your topic.
* If you want to select a topic specified by me, pls. come to talk first about your interest.

For all master theses, regardless of whether the topic is from industries or from me, you will have to work on a master thesis proposal to make sure that we (you and me) come to an agreement on the research and engineering questions and plans for your thesis, BEFORE we can officially register the thesis. Usually the thesis proposal will be short but includes:

* The overal context of the thesis: explain the introduction of the thesis, where is the position of the thesis in a larger context of the research and education.
* Research and engineering questions: what  are engineering and/or scientific challenges that the thesis is going to solve, and why? Does anybody do it before in your context, etc.

 Expected outcomes: e.g., which knowledge, solutions or software artefacts will be delivered, and how they are mapped to the research questions. Who would benefit from the outcomes

 * Approach: more concrete on possible inputs for the thesis, e.g., dataset, tools, etc. Highlights of the work approach, e.g., steps about literature studies, implementation, validation, etc.

Usually it would take around a month or even more with a lot of discussions to come up with a reasonable proposal, even for industrial topics. Therefore, if you want to do the thesis, you should contact me as early as possible.

## TU Wien courses

I maintain my teaching right at [TU Wien](www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at) but I dont have regular courses. If you want to do master theses, seminars or other courses, contact me directly.
